				This was the first day of something new.  
				I new I had to say something or else I would 
				not be able to finish my work on time.  On any 
				other day I may have overthought it.  But not 
				today.  Not. This. Day.</p>

				We are now in the second day of this 
				amazing journey that is learning.  
				What a crazy time to be alive, and 
				an even more crazy time to be learning.  
				If this is going to work than I must 
				find someway to organize all my thoughts.  
				But that will be for another day.</p>
